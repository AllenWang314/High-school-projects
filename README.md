High school project dump: Google's dino game, permutation research, USACO files, world's hardest game

- 2018 PRIMES contains files that I used to compute statistics on permutations while resolving Callan's conjecture: that the
number of ballot permutations is equal to the number of permutations of odd order. See https://oeis.org/A000246
- Dinosaur Game contains the files that replicate Google's "no internet" dinosaur game. In addition there's an AI that
trains an unbeatable dino through a genetic algorithm
- USACO Practice contains some solutions I wrote to the USA Computing Olympiad problems when I trained in the past. See http://usaco.org/
- USACO Solution contains a solution template that I use for competitions for the USACO
- World's Hardest Game contains files that implement http://www.theworlds-hardestgame.com/ and an AI using a genetic algorithm. This project did not reach full completion.
